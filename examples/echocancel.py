Acoustic echo cancellation in white background noise with NLMS.

Consider a scenario where two individuals, John and Emily, are talking over the
Internet. John is using his loudspeakers, which means Emily can hear herself
through John's microphone. The speech signal that Emily hears, is a distorted
version of her own. This is caused by the acoustic path from John's
loudspeakers to his microphone. This path includes attenuated echoes, etc.

Now for the problem!

Emily wishes to cancel the echo she hears from John's microphone. Emily only
knows the speech signal she sends to him, call that u(n), and the speech signal
she receives from him, call that d(n). To successfully remove her own echo
from d(n), she must approximate the acoustic path from John's loudspeakers to
his microphone. This path can be approximated by a FIR filter, which means an
adaptive NLMS FIR filter can be used to identify it. The model which Emily uses
to design this filter looks like this:

      u(n) ------->->------+----------->->-----------
                           |                        |
                  +-----------------+      +------------------+
              +->-| Adaptive filter |      |    John's Room   |
              |   +-----------------+      +------------------+
              |            | -y(n)                  |
              |            |           d(n)         |
      e(n) ---+---<-<------+-----------<-<----------+----<-<---- v(n)

As seen, the signal that is sent to John is also used as input to the adaptive
NLMS filter. The output of the filter, y(n), is subtracted from the signal
received from John, which results in an error signal e(n) = d(n)-y(n). By
feeding the error signal back to the adaptive filter, it can minimize the error
by approximating the impulse response (that is the FIR filter coefficients) of
John's room. Note that so far John's speech signal v(n) has not been taken into
account. If John speaks, the error should equal his speech, that is, e(n)
should equal v(n). For this simple example, however, we assume John is quiet
and v(n) is equal to white Gaussian background noise with zero-mean.

In the following example we keep the impulse response of John's room constant.
This is not required, however, since the advantage of adaptive filters, is that
they can be used to track changes in the impulse response.

A short speech sample is included in speech.npy, available on github or pypi in
the examples folder. The sample is single-channel and is in floating-point
format to keep the example simple. The original recording is sampled at 44.1
kHz, and has been downsampled by a factor of 4. To listen to any of the audio
signals of the example, they can be normalized and stored as wav files with
scipy:

    from scipy.io.wavfile import write
    write("d.wav", 44100/4, d/np.max(d))
