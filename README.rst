Adaptfilt
=========

Adaptfilt is an adaptive filtering module for Python. It includes simple, procedural implementations of the following filtering algorithms:

* **Least-mean-squares (LMS)** - including traditional and leaky filtering
* **Normalized least-mean-squares (NLMS)** - including traditional and leaky filtering with recursively updated input energy
* **Affine projection (AP)** - including traditional and leaky filtering
* **Recursive least squares (RLS)**

The algorithms are implemented using Numpy for computational efficiency. Further optimization have also been done, but this is very limited and only on the most computationally intensive parts of the source code.

Function Reference
------------------
In this section, the functions provided by adaptfilt are described. The descriptions correspond with excerpts from the function docstrings and are only included here for your convenience.

**y, e, w = lms(u, d, M, step, leak=0., initCoeffs=None, N=None, returnCoeffs=False)**

    Perform least-mean-squares (LMS) adaptive filtering on u to minimize error
    given by e=d-y, where y is the output of the adaptive filter.

    Parameters
        u : array-like
            One-dimensional filter input.
        d : array-like
            One-dimensional desired signal, i.e., the output of the unknown FIR
            system which the adaptive filter should identify. Must have length >=
            len(u), or N+M-1 if number of iterations are limited (via the N
            parameter).
        M : int
            Desired number of filter taps (desired filter order + 1), must be
            non-negative.

    Optional Parameters
        leak : float
            Leakage factor, must be equal to or greater than zero and smaller than
            one. When greater than zero a leaky LMS filter is used. Defaults to 0,
            i.e., no leakage.
        initCoeffs : array-like
            Initial filter coefficients to use. Should match desired number of

            (default).
        returnCoeffs : boolean
            If true, will return all filter coefficients for every iteration in an
            N x M matrix. Does not include the initial coefficients. If false, only
            the latest coefficients in a vector of length M is returned. Defaults
            to false.

Helper Function Reference
-------------------------
**mswe = mswe(w, v)**

    Calculate mean squared weight error between estimated and true filter
    coefficients, in respect to iterations.

    Parameters
        v : array-like
            True coefficients used to generate desired signal, must be a
            one-dimensional array.
        w : array-like
            Estimated coefficients from adaptive filtering algorithm. Must be an
            N x M matrix where N is the number of iterations, and M is the number
            of filter coefficients.

    Returns
        mswe : numpy.array
            One-dimensional array containing the mean-squared weight error for
            every iteration.

    Raises
        TypeError
            If inputs have wrong dimensions

    Note
        To use this function with the adaptive filter functions set the optional
        parameter returnCoeffs to True. This will return a coefficient matrix w
        corresponding with the input-parameter w.


Examples
--------
The following examples illustrate the use of the adaptfilt module. Note that the matplotlib.pyplot module is required to run them. 

Acoustic echo cancellation
++++++++++++++++++++++++++
::

  """
  Acoustic echo cancellation in white background noise with NLMS.

  Consider a scenario where two individuals, John and Emily, are talking over the
  Internet. John is using his loudspeakers, which means Emily can hear herself
  through John's microphone. The speech signal that Emily hears, is a distorted
  version of her own. This is caused by the acoustic path from John's
  loudspeakers to his microphone. This path includes attenuated echoes, etc.

  Now for the problem!

  Emily wishes to cancel the echo she hears from John's microphone. Emily only
  knows the speech signal she sends to him, call that u(n), and the speech signal
  she receives from him, call that d(n). To successfully remove her own echo
  from d(n), she must approximate the acoustic path from John's loudspeakers to
  his microphone. This path can be approximated by a FIR filter, which means an
  adaptive NLMS FIR filter can be used to identify it. The model which Emily uses
  to design this filter looks like this:

        u(n) ------->->------+----------->->-----------
                             |                        |
                    +-----------------+      +------------------+
                +->-| Adaptive filter |      |    John's Room   |
                |   +-----------------+      +------------------+
                |            | -y(n)                  |
                |            |           d(n)         |
        e(n) ---+---<-<------+-----------<-<----------+----<-<---- v(n)

  As seen, the signal that is sent to John is also used as input to the adaptive
  NLMS filter. The output of the filter, y(n), is subtracted from the signal
  received from John, which results in an error signal e(n) = d(n)-y(n). By
  feeding the error signal back to the adaptive filter, it can minimize the error
  by approximating the impulse response (that is the FIR filter coefficients) of
  John's room. Note that so far John's speech signal v(n) has not been taken into
  account. If John speaks, the error should equal his speech, that is, e(n)
  should equal v(n). For this simple example, however, we assume John is quiet
  and v(n) is equal to white Gaussian background noise with zero-mean.

  In the following example we keep the impulse response of John's room constant.
  This is not required, however, since the advantage of adaptive filters, is that
  they can be used to track changes in the impulse response.

  A short speech sample is included in speech.npy, available on github or pypi in
  the examples folder. The sample is single-channel and is in floating-point
  format to keep the example simple. The original recording is sampled at 44.1
  kHz, and has been downsampled by a factor of 4. To listen to any of the audio
  signals of the example, they can be normalized and stored as wav files with
  scipy:

      from scipy.io.wavfile import write
      write("d.wav", 44100/4, d/np.max(d))
